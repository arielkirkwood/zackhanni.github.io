We pride ourselves on having a relaxed, laid-back atmosphere, with the commitment, equipment, and quality of a major recording studio.

It's always valuable to have a fresh set of ears when mixing and mastering a song -- otherwise you develop bias and waste time nit-picking when you could be making your next hit.
